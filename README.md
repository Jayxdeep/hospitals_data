Hospital/Department Data mangement System
Project Overview
The Hospitals/Departments Data Management System is a web-based platform for securely managing hospital data. Built with MERN stack, it enables real-time updates, role-based access, and efficient monitoring for healthcare administrators. Despite initial authentication issues, it streamlines data handling, policy implementation, and scalability for improved healthcare management. 

Key Features (MVP)
User Authentication â€“ Secure registration & login with password hashing.
Role-Based Access Control â€“ Different roles for admin, hospital staff, and super admin.
Real-Time Data Management â€“ Hospitals & departments can update their data dynamically.
Centralized Dashboard â€“ Efficient monitoring and tracking of hospital data.
Scalability â€“ Supports multiple hospitals and future enhancements.
Security Measures â€“ Basic data encryption & validation for sensitive information.

ðŸš€ Current Development Progress
Backend (Node.js+Express+Mongo DB) âœ…
 Node.js backend initialized.
API endpoints for authentication and user management.
Implemented JWT-based authentication (still needs refinement).
User registration and login functionality working.
Data stored in MongoDB (currently local, needs cloud migration).
Frontend (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) âœ…
 Basic UI designed for authentication and dashboard.
Connected frontend with backend API using fetch requests.
Implemented local storage for session management.
Needs improvements in UI/UX (error handling, responsive design).
